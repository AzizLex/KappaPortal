# Kappa Blog Portal

In this project, we create a blog application using MVC. The website allows a user to create a blog, update the blog by adding posts or browse blogs made by other users.
ApplicationDbUser will exist from the start with a set of columns and some additional tables with ASP identity will be created as well.
